### Flickering fairy lights

Inspired by this [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeOw5MZWq24)

- Flickering pretty much there
- Colours pretty much there
- **Could**: Allow choice of colour
- **Should**: Check that tests still pass

### Random twinkling

- Now generates a gradient where hue doesn't change
- Fixed bug where shuffle combined with large number of steps led to bulbs starting a new twinkle before they'd finished a previous one
- **Should**: Factor in "gamma" / weight changes in luminosity to change based on perceived brightness
- **Should**: Accept list of colours instead of just one
