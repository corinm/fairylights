### TODO

* Create own function to generate range of colours between a colour and black (off). Need to factor in gamma https://gist.github.com/hexagon5un/3df734ad08d8dc8d9ace0491ef97cc58
* Implement this for rahdom_twinkling and check it generates sensible gradients
* Example random_twinkling to accept a list of colours
* Add rainbow to FSM
